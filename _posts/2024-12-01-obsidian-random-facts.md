#### Here's the code for the Random Space Facts:

```yaml
```dataviewjs
// Space Facts Array
const spaceFacts = [
    "A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus.",
    "There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the Earth's beaches.",
    "Neutron stars are so dense that a teaspoon of their material would weigh about 6 billion tons.",
    "The largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is on Mars.",
    "A solar flare can release as much energy as the Sun does in 24 hours.",
    "Saturn's moon Titan has lakes and rivers of liquid methane.",
    "Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a massive storm that's been raging for over 350 years.",
    "The first living creatures to orbit the Earth were fruit flies.",

    "A day on Mercury is twice as long as its year.",
    "The Hubble Space Telescope has taken some of the most detailed images of deep space.",
    "The Milky Way galaxy is on a collision course with the Andromeda galaxy.",

];

// Get a random space fact
const randomFact = spaceFacts[Math.floor(Math.random() * spaceFacts.length)];

// Display the random space fact
const container = this.container;
container.createEl("h1", { text: `ðŸŒŒ Random Space Fact ðŸŒ ` });
container.createEl("p", { text: randomFact });
```
### Random Space Facts Script Explanation

This script displays a **random space fact** each time you open your Obsidian note, adding a fun and dynamic element to your vault. It will show one fact at a time, and you can refresh the page to get a new one.

#### How It Works:
1. **Create the Facts Array**: The script contains an array of space-related facts. 
2. **Random Fact Selection**: It selects a random fact from the array each time the note is viewed.
3. **Display the Fact**: The script creates two elements in your Obsidian note â€” a heading (`h1`) and a paragraph (`p`) â€” to display the randomly selected space fact.

#### Why Use This?
- **Ever-changing Content**: Each time you view the note, a new random space fact is displayed, keeping things interesting.
- **Educational and Fun**: A great way to add some learning and fun to your notes, all while exploring space-related trivia.
- **Customization**: You can easily replace the facts in the array or adapt the script to show facts about any other topic you prefer.

Give it a try and enjoy your dynamic space facts! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
