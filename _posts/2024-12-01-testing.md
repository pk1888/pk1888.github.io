### Random Space Facts in Obsidian with DataviewJS

Add some excitement to your Obsidian vault by displaying a **random fact** each time you view your note. Using **DataviewJS**, you can create a dynamic block that shows a random space fact whenever you open your note.

#### Here's the code for the Random Space Facts:

```yaml
```dataviewjs

// Space Facts Array

const spaceFacts = [

Â  Â  "A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus.",
Â  Â  
Â  Â  "There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the Earth's beaches.",
Â  Â  
Â  Â  "Neutron stars are so dense that a teaspoon of their material would weigh about 6 billion tons.",

Â  Â  "The largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is on Mars.",
];

// Get a random space fact

const randomFact = spaceFacts[Math.floor(Math.random() * spaceFacts.length)];

// Display the random space fact
const container = this.container;
container.createEl("h1", { text: `ðŸŒŒ Random Space Fact ðŸŒ ` });
container.createEl("p", { text: randomFact });
```

### Random Space Facts Script Explanation

This script displays a **random space fact** each time you open your Obsidian note, adding a fun and dynamic element to your vault. It will show one fact at a time, and you can refresh the page to get a new one.

#### How It Works:

1. **Create the Facts Array**: The script contains an array of space-related facts.

2. **Random Fact Selection**: It selects a random fact from the array each time the note is viewed.

3. **Display the Fact**: The script creates two elements in your Obsidian note â€” a heading (`h1`) and a paragraph (`p`) â€” to display the randomly selected space fact.

#### Why Use This?

- **Ever-changing Content**: Each time you view the note, a new random space fact is displayed, keeping things interesting.

- **Educational and Fun**: A great way to add some learning and fun to your notes, all while exploring space-related trivia.

- **Customization**: You can easily replace the facts in the array or adapt the script to show facts about any other topic you prefer.

Give it a try and enjoy your dynamic facts! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
