Hi, I'm Paul! 👋

# Welcome to my little corner of the web 🌍

This site is primarily a personal reference where I store:

- **Code snippets** 💻: Handy bits of code I’ve written or come across.
- **Tutorials** 📚: Guides that have helped me or ones I’ve created to clarify concepts.
- **Personal thoughts** 💭: Musings, ideas, and anything else that comes to mind.

The site probably won’t have a lot of structure — it’s more of a digital notebook than a polished blog. ✍️

This is my first static markdown site, so it may break from time to time as I continue to learn to use Jekyll. Thanks for your patience while I figure things out! 🙏

I used to work with WordPress, which is fantastic software, but I always felt it was a bit bloated with too many plugins. The learning curve can get steep, and I found myself spending more time managing plugins than actually creating content. 🤔 That’s when I realized I prefer simple, lightweight solutions. Now, with this static site, there’s no database to worry about — it’s just efficient and streamlined, which suits me perfectly. 🚀

Feel free to explore, and maybe you’ll find something useful or interesting along the way! 🌟
