## Welcome to My Little Corner of the Web 🌍

Hey there, I'm Paul! 👋

This site is my personal reference hub, where I store things I find useful:

- **Code Snippets** 💻: Handy bits of code I've written or discovered.
- **Tutorials** 📚: Guides that have helped me, or ones I've created to clarify concepts.
- **Personal Thoughts** 💭: Musings, ideas, and anything else that comes to mind.

This space doesn’t have much structure — think of it more like a digital notebook than a polished blog. ✍️

It's my first time building a static markdown site, so it might break from time to time as I continue learning the ropes with Jekyll. Thanks for your patience as I figure things out! 🙏

I used to work with WordPress — it's amazing software, no doubt — but I always felt it was a bit bloated with plugins. The learning curve got steep, and I often found myself managing plugins more than actually creating content. 🤔 That’s when I realized I prefer simple, lightweight solutions. With this static site, there’s no database to worry about — it's fast, efficient, and streamlined, which suits me perfectly. 🚀

Feel free to explore, and maybe you'll find something useful or interesting along the way! 🌟

- Paul 👋 👋
