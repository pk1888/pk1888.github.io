Hi, I'm Paul! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the web. This site is primarily a personal reference where I store:

- **Code snippets**: Handy bits of code I've written or come across.
- **Tutorials**: Guides that have helped me or ones I've created to clarify concepts.
- **Personal thoughts**: Musings, ideas, and anything else that comes to mind.

The site probably won't have a lot of structure â€” it's more of a digital notebook than a polished blog.  

This is my first static markdown site, so it may break from time to time as I continue to learn to use **Jekyll**. Thanks for your patience while I figure things out!

Feel free to explore, and maybe you'll find something useful or interesting along the way!

â€” Paul
